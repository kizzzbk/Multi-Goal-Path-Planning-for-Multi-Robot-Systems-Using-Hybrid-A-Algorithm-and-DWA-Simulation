# üß≠ Multi-Goal Path Planning for Multi-Robot Systems in Dynamic Environments Using Hybrid A* and DWA

## üìñ Overview
This project presents a **hybrid path planning framework** for **multi-robot, multi-goal navigation** in **dynamic environments** which integrates the **A*** algorithm for **global path planning** and the **Dynamic Window Approach (DWA)** for **local obstacle avoidance**.  
The system aims to ensure **collision-free**, **energy-efficient**, and **adaptive navigation** for multiple autonomous robots operating simultaneously.

## üöÄ Key Features
- **Hybrid Planning:** Combines global (A*) and local (DWA) planners.
- **Multi-Robot Coordination:** Assigns multiple goals among robots using an energy-aware greedy algorithm.
- **Dynamic Obstacle Handling:** Avoids both static and moving obstacles in real time.
- **Energy-Aware Allocation:** Each robot‚Äôs energy is considered in goal assignment.
- **Simulation-Ready:** Designed for 2D simulated environments with static maps and dynamic agents.

## üß© System Architecture

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Phase 1: Goal Assignment**
- Parses environment maps into grids.
- Assigns multiple goals to robots using an **energy-aware greedy algorithm**.
- Ensures balanced energy use and optimized path length.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Phase 2: Path Planning**
- Uses **A*** for global path generation (based on static obstacles).
- Applies **Dynamic Window Approach (DWA)** for local obstacle avoidance.
- Robots adaptively adjust velocity and heading based on predicted obstacle motion.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithms

### **A*** Global Planner
- Generates the optimal path from start to goal using grid-based search.
- Uses the **Chebyshev distance** heuristic for efficient exploration.

### **Dynamic Window Approach (DWA)**
- Samples feasible velocities within dynamic constraints.
- Evaluates candidates using an **objective function** that balances:
  - Goal progression (`ŒîD`)
  - Obstacle cost (`Co`)
  - Weight factors (`wf`, `wo`)

### **Energy-Aware Goal Assignment (Algorithm 1)**
- Assigns goals based on minimum effective cost considering:
  - Path distance
  - Energy requirement
  - Charging needs

## üß† Experimental Setup
- Simulated in a **2D environment** (L √ó W map).
- Static obstacles represented as occupancy grids.
- Dynamic obstacles move with random velocities and bounce upon collisions.
- Robots are initialized with energy limits and pre-defined kinematic constraints.

### **Metrics Evaluated**
- Total path length  
- Average execution time  
- Collision rate  
- Navigation efficiency

## üìä Results
- **Hybrid A* + DWA** significantly outperforms standalone DWA:
  - Shorter and smoother trajectories.
  - Fewer collisions with static and dynamic obstacles.
  - Better goal tracking and inter-robot coordination.
- Robots successfully complete all assigned tasks and return to the charging station.

## üß© Future Work
- Integration with **real-world robot platforms** (e.g., TurtleBot, Pioneer).
- Extending to **3D environments** or **non-holonomic systems**.
- Applying **reinforcement learning** to optimize planner parameters.
